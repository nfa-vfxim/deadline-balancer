# Deadline balancer
Script to automatically balance all jobs rendering according to their priority. This will allow rendering multiple jobs simultaneously.

There is also a license limit function (`LicenseLimit`), which will prevent the job from rendering with too many pc's at the same time when licensing is limited.
